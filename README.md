# CS-300-ABCU
# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem being solved for the projects in this course had to do with using different data storage types to obtain, sotre, sort, and then display
data depending on a users input. The particular data to be used were courses within a computer science degree program at ABCU and whether those courses had prerequisites.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
In approaching the problem different methods were used to include vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. Once each method was tested a determination of the best 
fitting method was made. Data structures are important to understand because they provide efficiency and reusability within programs. Data structures are meant to be used
to store and retrieve user data as quickly as possible.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
In overcoming roadblocks I did a lot of researching and referenced my textbook. I looked for similar code or programs in which the data methods were used to familiarize myself
with their usage and how they would look being implemented in a program.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
My work on this project has made it easier for me to understand how a program may store information and which methods are best for different sets of data.
This will allow me to make better choices in the future when working on other projects in which data storage and retreival are necessary, which is quite often.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The project and the coverage of data storage and retreival methods have given me a better understanding of how a program can easily be reused for different
programs. This will help me save time in the future and make it easier for me to update and maintain code.
